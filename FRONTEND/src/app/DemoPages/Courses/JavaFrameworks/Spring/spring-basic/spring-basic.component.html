        <h6>Benefits Of Using Spring</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Spring works on IOC (inversion of control) or DI (dependency injection) design pattern.</li>
          <li>Spring provides container to create and manage objects and also provides enterprise services to those objects.</li>
          <li>Spring is an open source application development framework.</li> 
          <li>It provides components for different tiers of application e.g. web, middle/business and data access.</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>Benefits Of Using Spring</h6>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Core container : </b> BeanFactory, an implementation of the Factory pattern is an essential component of core container. The BeanFactory applies the Inversion of Control (IOC) pattern to separate an application's configuration and dependency specification from the actual application code.</li>
        <li><b>Spring context : </b>Spring context comprise of configuration file that provides context information to the Spring framework. The Spring context includes enterprise services such as internalization, validation, JNDI, and scheduling functionality.</li>
        <li><b>Spring AOP : </b>Spring AOP module integrates aspect-oriented programming functionality directly into the Spring framework, through its configuration management feature. Through AOP services like transaction control, logging etc can be easily managed. </li>
        <li><b>Spring DAO : </b>Spring DAO makes it easy to work with relational database management systems on the Java platform using JDBC and object-relational mapping tools. Spring JDBC DAO abstraction layer offers a meaningful exception hierarchy for managing the exception handling and error messages thrown by different database vendors. The exception hierarchy simplifies error handling and greatly reduces the amount of exception code you need to write, such as opening and closing connections.</li>
        <li><b>Spring ORM : </b>The Spring framework plugs into several ORM frameworks to provide its Object Relational tool, including JDO, Hibernate, and iBatis SQL Maps.</li>
        <li><b>Spring Web module : </b>Built on top of the application context module, providing contexts for Web-based applications. As a result, the Spring framework supports integration with Jakarta Struts. The Web module also eases the tasks of handling multi-part requests and binding request parameters to domain objects.</li>
        <li><b>Spring MVC framework : </b>Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework is a full-featured MVC implementation for building Web applications. The MVC framework is highly configurable via strategy interfaces and assembles various view technologies including JSP, Tiles, iText, and POI.</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Spring Container</h6>
    <div><span><ul>In order to have a better understanding of spring we need to understand how spring works. Spring has gained it's popularity for Dependency Injection. Its only possible because Spring is a container of beans. You can imagine container like JVM. JVM is a container. When we create an object in java, it is the container or the JVM which is responsible to control the lifecycle of those objects.</ul></span></div>
    <div><span><ul>Similarly Spring is a container. But it is a container of beans. It can contain as many objects as it wants. Those objects are completely managed by Spring, starting from creation to destruction.</ul></span></div>

               <span> <b>Spring Bean Factory / ApplicationContext</b></span>
              
        </ng-template><br><br>
        <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
          <ul>In order to understand Spring Bean Factory we need to know a little about Factory Pattern.</ul>
          <h5 class="mb-3 mt-3">Factory Pattern</h5>
          <div><span><ul><img src="/assets/images/course/FactoryPattern.png" alt="image"></ul></span></div>
          <div><span><ul>
                      <li>Say you have a Vehicle showroom. Which sells Car, Jeep, Bike etc. The showroom works in the following way. When a customer comes to buy a specific vehicle (Car, jeep etc), you send the order to the 'Vehicle Production Factory' where that specific vehicle is made with the help of some raw materials, which is taken from the internal storage of the factory. Once the Vehicle is made by the 'Vehicle Production Factory', its handed over to the 'Vehicle Showroom'.</li>
                      <li>So, the 'Vehicle Showroom' is not making the Vehicle but sends the order to the 'Vehicle Production Factory' Where the Vehicle is produced and handed over to the 'Vehicle Showroom'.</li>
                      <li>Now, if you consider the 'Vehicle' as a class, you will be able to understand that the 'Vehicle' class is not creating an object by itself. Rather it is taking the help of some 'Factory' which is creating an object for the Vehicle class by taking the help of so called 'Internal storage of the factory' which can be an XML file. This is Factory Pattern. Now we will take the help of Factory Pattern in order to understand Spring Bean Factory .</li>
                     </ul></span>
          </div>

         <h5 class="mb-3 mt-3">Spring Bean Factory / ApplicationContext</h5>
         <div><span><ul>
            <li>Spring follows Factory Pattern to handle the beans. And as we have seen in factory pattern that, instead of creating a new object yourself, you ask a factory(Spring Bean Factory in this case) to create the object for you.</li>
            <li>Let us illustrate with the below diagram:</li>
            <div><span><ul><img src="/assets/images/course/SpringBeanFactory.png" alt="image"></ul></span></div>
         </ul></span>
          </div>
          <div><span>
            <ul>1. From your application, when you request Spring to create a new object for you. Spring takes the help of Spring Bean Factory or Application Context.</ul>
            <ul>2. Then, Spring Bean Factory/Application Context takes the help of an XML file(Say application-context.xml), which contains the definition of all the beans that needs to be created.</ul>
            <ul>3. After Bean Factory/Application Context gets the bean definition from application-context.xml, it creates a bean.</ul>
            <ul>4. And hands it over to your Application.</ul>
          </span>
          </div>
          <h5 class="mb-3 mt-3">How does Spring know about the Beans it needs to create?</h5>
          <div><span>
            <ul>The bean can be considered an equivalent of a java class. Creating a bean is same as creating an object using 'new' keyword in java.</ul>
            <ul>If you want spring to create objects for you, you need to inform spring about all the objects that spring has to create for you.</ul>
            <ul>Say there is a class called 'Car' :</ul>
          
          
            <div class="mb-3 card text-white card-body"
            style="background-color: rgb(51, 51, 51); border-color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"> &nbsp;&nbsp;class Car{{openBrace}}<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;String brand;<br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public String getBrand() {{openBrace}}<br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return brand;<br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{closeBrace}}<br>
           <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void setBrand(String brand) {{openBrace}}<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.brand = brand;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{closeBrace}}<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp; {{closeBrace}} 
       </div>
          <ul>And you want spring to create a 'Car' object for you. So, you have to provide the details of the 'Car' class in the XML file 'application-context.xml'.</ul>
          </span>
        </div>
       
    <div class="mb-1 card text-white card-body bg-warning">NOTE : You can give any name to 'application-context.xml'.
